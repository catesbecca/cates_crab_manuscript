# cates_crab_manuscript

This repository includes all data, protocols, and R scripts associated with the manuscript "Effect of Sea Otter (Enhydra lutris) Predation and Habitat Structure on Nearshore Crab Assemblages in Southeast Alaska" by Rebecca Cates, "[Wendel Raymond](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wendel-Raymond)", "[Lia Domke](https://github.com/lkdomke)", and "[Ginny Eckert](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ginny-Eckert)". This manuscript has been adapted from "[R.Cates master's thesis](https://scholarworks.alaska.edu/handle/11122/12932)" at the University of Alaska Fairbanks College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences. Data includes nearshore crab assemblage, seagrass biometric, and sea otter density data from 2017-2020 and is associated with the large, interdisciplinary project "[APECS](http://apecs-ak.org/)". 

This repository is organized into the following folders:

## [Protocols](Protocols)

This folder includes field protocols (.pdf) used for this project. The Protocols folder is divided into sub-folders based on the type of measurements/methods (e.g., "Sea Otter Density" or "Seagrass Biometrics" or "Crab Metrics"). See Protocols_README within the Protocols folder for more details.

## [Data and Scripts](Data&Scripts)

This folder includes all data files (.csv) and R scripts (.Rmd) used for data analysis and figures in the manuscript. The Data and Scripts folder is organized into sub-folders containing both data files and R scripts associated with a particular category of crab response variables (e.g., "Size Distribution"). See Data&Scripts_README within the Data and Scripts folder for more details.

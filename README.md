# cates_crab_manuscript

This repository includes all data, protocols, and R scripts associated with the manuscript "Effect of Sea Otter (Enhydra lutris) Predation and Habitat Structure on Nearshore Crab Assemblages in Southeast Alaska" by Rebecca Cates, Wendel Raymond, Lia Domke, and Ginny Eckert. This manuscript has been adapted from R.Cates master's thesis at the University of Alaska Fairbanks College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences. Data includes nearshore crab assemblage, seagrass biometric, and sea otter density data from 2017-2020 and is associated with the large, interdisciplinary project "APECS". 

This repository is organized into the following folders:

Protocols

This folder includes field protocols (.pdf) used for this project. The Protocols folder is divided into sub-folders based on the type of measurements/methods (e.g., "Sea Otter Density" or "Habitat Complexity" or "Crab Response Variables"). See Protocols_README within the Protocols folder for more details.

Data and Scripts

This folder includes all data files (.csv) and R scripts (.Rmd) used for data analysis and figures in the manuscript. The Data and Scripts folder is organized into sub-folders containing both data files and R scripts associated with a particular category of crab response variables (e.g., "Size Distribution"). See Data&Scripts_README within the Data and Scripts folder for more details.
